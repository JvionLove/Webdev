    <p> My name is J'vion Love. I am an inspiring web developer from Buffalo, New York. I started learning to code my junior year of high school learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From there I learned Python my senior year and eventaully went to college for Computer Science. However, after the pandemic I soon lost motivation to pursue a career in IT and eventually switched my major to Digital Media Arts. In 2023, I received my bachelor's degree. However, after a few internships I decided not to follow my degree path and go back into IT. Prior to switching my major, I never really had a set career path in IT I wanted to pursue, so it was easy to for me to lose focus. However, during one of my internships, one of my tasks was to make updates to a website using WordPress. Doing the project allowed me to develop skills such as problem-solving and communication. I fell in love with watching the changes I made go live right in front me. This is what sparked me to dive deeper into web development. Although web development is my favorite part of IT, I am open to other interests such as cybersecurity, helpdesk, and software engineering.</p>
